Build ntel whenever any layer changes

Works by adding an extra step to ntel builds that checks the
change sourestamps and checks out changed layers. Potentially this
could detect changes to multiple layers if they fall within the
tree stable timeout.

This really only works for layers in the same group on gitlab, so any
repository under /ntel/.
