Add vmdaedalus inventory

Add 'restore' tag to tasks. By tagging the tasks, restoration can be skipped using --skip-tags
option to ansible-playbook. This is useful for testing ansible plays
on systems without tapedrives or established backups.

Add Vagrant configuration

Set docker container restart_policy to no for testing purposes

Add bacula-restores task to symlink backup files to bacula restore folder

Comment out restore file permission tasks:
