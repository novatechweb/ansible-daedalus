	help
	  the U-Boot fw_printenv and fw_setenv commands are used to
	  read and write U-Boot environment /dev/mtdX partitions on
	  target through linux.
	  The tool will require a configuration on target named
	  /etc/fw_env.config. See U-Boot source directory tools/env
	  for detailed description.
	  Choosing this option will install a /etc/fw_env.config to
	  target-fs either from your BSP or a generic one which is
	  likely to not work with your board. Please read the
	  comments in that generic configuration.
