		  Cracklib does not supply a large wordlist to
		  generate the cracklib dictionary from. This is
		  left as a manual step.
		  The generated cracklib dictionary files are
		  NOT byte-order independent and are probably
		  ARCHITECTURE SPECIFIC.
		  It is suggested to install cracklib and it's
		  acompaning programs onto the target along with
		  a word list and generate the cracklib
		  dictionary files. These files can then be
		  palaced into the projectroot directory to be
		  included into the package.
