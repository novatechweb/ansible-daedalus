	  The Round Robin Database Tool (RRDtool) is a system to store and
	  display time-series data (e.g. network bandwidth, machine-room
	  temperature, server load average). It stores the data in Round
	  Robin Databases (RRDs), a very compact way that will not expand
	  over time. RRDtool processes the extracted data to enforce a
	  certain data density, allowing for useful graphical
	  representation of data values.
