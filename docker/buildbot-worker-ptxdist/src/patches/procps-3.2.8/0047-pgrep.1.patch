 .SH DESCRIPTION
 \fBpgrep\fP looks through the currently running processes and lists the
 process IDs which matches the selection criteria to stdout.  All
 the criteria have to match.  For example,
 
-pgrep -u root sshd
+.IP
+$ pgrep \-u root sshd
 
+.PP
 will only list the processes called \fBsshd\fP AND owned by \fBroot\fP.
 On the other hand,
 
-pgrep -u root,daemon
+.IP
+$ pgrep \-u root,daemon
 
+.PP
 will list the processes owned by \fBroot\fP OR \fBdaemon\fP.
 
 \fBpkill\fP will send the specified signal (by default \fBSIGTERM\fP)
