+.SH NOTES
+The output for Idle, JCPU and PCPU times vaires depending on if you use
+the \-o (old style) option or not. These formats can be confusing if you
+switch between the old style and standard.  In the following paragraphs
+days are DD, hours HH, minutes MM, seconds SS and 100ths of seconds CC.
+
+The standard format is DDdays, HH:MMm, MM:SS or SS.CC if the times are
+greater than 2 days, 1hour, or 1 minute respectively.
+
+For the \-o option, the output will be either  DDdays, HH:MM, MM:SSm or
+blank if the times are greater than 2 days, 1 hour or 1 minute
+respectively.
